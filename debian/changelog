ros-jade-pid (0.0.10-0utopic) utopic; urgency=high

  * Add diagnostics running at 4Hz. Publish interesting data like setpoint, plant state,
  error, control effort in diags for viewing
  * Add ROS private parameters to set Pid params and simulator param
  * Add Auto/Manual mode: Listen to the /pid_enable topic for a std_msgs/Bool
  that will disable or re-enable output from the PID controller
  * Support reverse_acting parameter, for plants where the control input acts
  in the opposite direction to the plant-state. E.g. Differential-drive robots
  often have one direct and one reverse-acting PID
  * Support faster-than-wallclock simulation via a /clock publisher and the
  /use_sim_time parameter
  * Add launch files for first & 2nd order behaviors. Get them to launch plots,
  diag monitor, reconfigure gui
  * Split setpoint generator out into a separate node
  * Rename simulator to plant_sim.cpp & give it 1st & 2nd order behaviors, configured
  with a parameter.
  * Delete first_order_plant_sim.cpp, which is subsumed into plant_sim.cpp. Remove
  plant header, which was almost content-free.
  * Remove msg directory & switch to using Float64 messages for setpoint,
  process state, & control effort. Now it's generic - no special messages needed.
  * Explicitly call out std namespace to avoid accidental name conflicts
  * Remove parameter length checks to allow parameters to be set in part from
  launch file (the usual way), and in part from cmd line args (an infrequently-used
  way)
  * Rename pid_header.h to controller.h because it's used by controller.cpp - more standard
  C++ naming style
  * Add copyrights
